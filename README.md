ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Brichaelle and I'm new to the world of Data Analytics
Iâ€™m interested in honing my skills in the best way possible and become better at what I do.
Iâ€™m currently still learning a whole bunch of stuff but its exciting and new and really just challenging me to do my best.
I'm happy you stopped by to look at what I've been working on and I hope my progress is evident!
